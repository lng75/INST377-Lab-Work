        <h1>Lucas Ng Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should list your top 5 favorite albums below.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Metrowing - Alice</li>
            <li>Foreground Eclipse - Wishes Hidden in the Foreground Noise</li>
            <li>goreshit - semantics: the benzo chronicles</li>
            <li>goreshit - semantic compositions on death and its meaning</li>
            <li>potsu - just friends</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>

        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

        <img src='mochi_images/mochi.jpg' width='100' alt='A smiling mochi surrounded in a bubble.'/> <img src='mochi_images/mochi.gif' width='100' alt='A bouncing, happy mochi.'/> <img src='mochi_images/mochi.png' width='100' alt='A smiling mochi.'/> <img src='mochi_images/mochi.svg' width='100' alt='A smiling mochi surrounded on each direction with segmented lines.'/>
