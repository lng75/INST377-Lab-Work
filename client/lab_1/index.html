        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

        Sometimes you want to do both.

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

        <h2>Images</h2>

        Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

        Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
        If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
